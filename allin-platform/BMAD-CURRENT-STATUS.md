### **Phase 5: DEPLOY (Week 3) - Final Validation & Production Deployment**

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Achieve 95+ overall score and deploy to production

#### **Step 1: Load Testing & Performance Validation** (8-10 hours)

**Objective**: Verify system performs under production load

**Tasks**:
1. **Setup Load Testing Tools**
   - Install k6, Artillery, or Apache JMeter
   - Configure test scenarios
   - Set up monitoring dashboards

2. **Execute Load Tests**
   - Test with 100 concurrent users (baseline)
   - Test with 500 concurrent users (target load)
   - Test with 1000+ concurrent users (stress test)
   - Test with 2000+ concurrent users (breaking point)

3. **Validate Performance Metrics**
   - Response times stay under 200ms P95
   - Cache hit rate maintains 90%+
   - Database connection pool stability
   - No memory leaks
   - No connection exhaustion

4. **Measure Specific Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Health checks under load
   - /health -> <10ms P95
   - /api/health -> <50ms P95 (with caching)
   - /api/health/database -> <100ms P95

   # Authentication endpoints
   - /api/auth/login -> <200ms P95
   - /api/auth/register -> <300ms P95

   # OAuth endpoints
   - /api/social/connect/* -> <500ms P95
   ```

5. **Expected Results**
   - ✅ 1000+ concurrent users supported
   - ✅ <200ms P95 response times maintained
   - ✅ 90%+ cache hit rate under load
   - ✅ Zero timeout errors
   - ✅ Graceful degradation under extreme load

   - Validate key rotation capability

5. **Security Headers Check**
   ```bash
   # Test with:
   curl -I http://localhost:7000/api/health

   # Should see:
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Strict-Transport-Security (if HTTPS)
   ```

**Expected Results**:
