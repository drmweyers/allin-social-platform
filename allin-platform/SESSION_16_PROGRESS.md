## 🔧 Technical Solutions Applied

### TypeScript Fixes
1. **Unused Variables:** Prefix with underscore (_variableName)

## 📝 Next Steps for Session 16

### Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Fix TypeScript issues in analytics.service.ts
2. ✅ Get analytics.service tests running (partially passing)
3. ⬜ Write scheduling.service.test.ts (30+ tests)
4. ⬜ Add more route handler tests
5. ⬜ Fix failing analytics tests to get all passing

### Target Metrics
- **Goal:** 40% overall coverage
- **Current:** 23.78% (59% of the way there)
- **Needed:** +16.22% more coverage
- **Test Count Goal:** 200+ tests
- **Current:** 135 tests (need 65+ more)
