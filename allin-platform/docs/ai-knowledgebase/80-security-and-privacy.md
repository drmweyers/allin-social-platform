## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**User Hierarchy**:
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  SUPER_ADMIN   // Platform administration
  ADMIN         // Organization management
  USER          // Standard permissions
}

enum MemberRole {
  OWNER         // Full organization control
  ADMIN         // User/billing management
  EDITOR        // Content creation/publishing
  MEMBER        // Limited content creation
  VIEWER        // Read-only access
}
```

**Permission Matrix**:
