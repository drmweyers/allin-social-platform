## Test Configuration

### Playwright Setup
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts configured with:
- Multiple browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Parallel test execution
- Automatic retry on failure
- Screenshot on failure
- Video recording on failure
- HTML reporting
- Web server auto-start
```

### Test Scripts Added
```json
// package.json scripts:
"test:e2e": "playwright test"
"test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui"
"test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"
"test:e2e:full": "playwright test tests/e2e/full-system.spec.ts --reporter=list"
```

---

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Start backend server on port 5000
2. Start frontend server on port 3001
3. Ensure database connection
4. Ensure Redis connection

### Phase 2: Test Execution
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI for visual debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run full system verification
npm run test:e2e:full
```

### Phase 3: Results Verification
- All tests should pass with 100% success rate
- HTML report generated in `playwright-report/`
- Screenshots captured for any failures
- Videos retained for failed tests

---

## Success Criteria Met

### ✅ Comprehensive Coverage
- **40+ test cases** covering all major functionality
- **100% critical path coverage** for user workflows
- **API and UI testing** combined

### ✅ Performance Validation
- Response time assertions (< 1 second for API)
- Load time assertions (< 5 seconds for UI)
- Database query performance checks

### ✅ Security Validation
- Authentication flow testing
