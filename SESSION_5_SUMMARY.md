- **Multi-step approval workflows**: Configurable approval chains with role-based permissions
- **Workflow state management**: Tracks progress through approval steps
- **Event-driven architecture**: EventEmitter for real-time workflow updates
- **Features implemented**:
  - Create and manage custom workflows
  - Process approval actions (Approve, Reject, Request Changes)
  - Track workflow activities and history
  - Get pending approvals by user role
  - Auto-publish on approval completion

#### 2. Collaboration Service (`backend/src/services/collaboration.service.ts`)

- **Activity logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Features implemented**:
  - Add, update, delete comments
  - Comment reactions with emojis
  - User mentions extraction and notifications
  - Team member status tracking (online/away/offline)
  - Activity log with filtering
  - Task assignment with notifications

#### 3. API Endpoints Created

**Workflow Routes** (`backend/src/routes/workflow.routes.ts`):
- `POST /api/workflow/workflows` - Create workflow for post
- `POST /api/workflow/:postId/approve` - Process approval action
- `GET /api/workflow/:postId` - Get workflow status
- `GET /api/workflow/pending/approvals` - Get pending approvals
- `GET /api/workflow/:workflowId/activities` - Get workflow history
- `POST /api/workflow/config` - Create custom workflow configuration

**Collaboration Routes** (`backend/src/routes/collaboration.routes.ts`):
- `POST /api/collaboration/comments` - Add comment
- `GET /api/collaboration/comments/:postId` - Get comments
- `PUT /api/collaboration/comments/:commentId` - Update comment
- `DELETE /api/collaboration/comments/:commentId` - Delete comment
- `POST /api/collaboration/comments/:commentId/reactions` - Add reaction

- `PUT /api/collaboration/team/status` - Update user status
- `GET /api/collaboration/activities` - Get activity logs
- `POST /api/collaboration/tasks/assign` - Assign task

### Frontend UI Components

#### 1. Workflow Management Page (`frontend/app/dashboard/workflow/page.tsx`)
- **Approval queue interface**: List of pending approvals with preview
- **Content review panel**: Full content display with media
- **Approval actions**: Approve, Reject, Request Changes buttons
- **Activity timeline**: Shows workflow history and comments
- **Progress tracking**: Visual indicators for approval status
- **Comment system**: Add comments during review process

#### 2. Team Collaboration Dashboard (`frontend/app/dashboard/team/page.tsx`)
- **Team members grid**: Shows all team members with status
- **Comments section**: Real-time team comments with @mentions
- **Notifications center**: Unread count, notification list, mark as read
- **Activity log**: Comprehensive audit trail of all actions
- **Search and filtering**: Find team members and content quickly
- **Status indicators**: Online/offline/away status for team members

## üìà Metrics
- **New Files Created**: 6 major files
- **Lines of Code Added**: ~2,500
- **Features Implemented**: 15+ collaboration features
- **API Endpoints**: 18 new endpoints
- **UI Components**: 2 comprehensive dashboard pages
- **Services**: 2 major backend services with event emission

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Event-Driven Design
- Both services extend EventEmitter for real-time updates
- Events emitted: workflowCreated, approvalProcessed, commentAdded, notificationCreated, etc.
- Ready for Socket.io integration for real-time frontend updates

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Redis**: Used for real-time data (comments, notifications, activities)
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for workflow configurations
- **TTL Strategy**: 24 hours for workflows, 7 days for notifications, 30 days for activities

### Role-Based Access Control
- Hierarchical role system: OWNER > ADMIN > MEMBER > VIEWER
- Role checking for approval workflows
- Permission validation for comment deletion

## üöß Known Issues & Pending Tasks

### Backend Issues
1. TypeScript compilation errors in social.routes.ts (from previous sessions)
2. Missing return statements in some route handlers
3. User type definitions need fixing for req.user properties

### Pending Features
