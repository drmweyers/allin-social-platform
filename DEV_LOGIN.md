# Development Login Credentials

## Persistent Dev Account (NEVER CHANGES)

This account is **automatically created** every time the development server starts. You will **never** need to manually create or restore these credentials.

### Login Credentials

```
Email:    dev@example.com
Password: DevPassword123!
Role:     ADMIN
```

### Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:7001
- **Login Page**: http://localhost:7001/auth/login
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:7000

## How It Works

### Automatic Seeding on Startup

Every time you start the development server, the system automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Checks if the dev user exists in the database
2. ‚úÖ Creates the user if it doesn't exist
3. ‚úÖ Updates the user if it already exists (ensuring password is correct)
4. ‚úÖ Displays credentials in the console output

### Console Output

When the server starts, you'll see this message:

```
============================================================
‚úì DEV USER SEEDED
  Email: dev@example.com
  Password: DevPassword123!
  Role: ADMIN
  Status: ACTIVE
============================================================
```

## No Manual Intervention Required

You will **NEVER** need to:

- ‚ùå Manually create this user
- ‚ùå Run database migrations for this user
- ‚ùå Worry about losing these credentials after code changes
- ‚ùå Rebuild your development environment to restore login

## When To Use

‚úÖ **Use this account for:**
- Daily development work
- Testing authentication flows
- Admin-level feature testing
- Quick login during development

‚ùå **Do NOT use this account for:**
- Production environments (automatically disabled)
- Client demonstrations (use demo data instead - see MOCK_DATA.md)
- Testing specific user roles (use demo data instead)

## Additional Test Accounts

For testing different user roles and scenarios, see:
- **Demo Data**: Run `npm run seed:demo` for comprehensive mock data
- **Master Test Accounts**: See CLAUDE.md for permanent test credentials

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error

If you encounter login issues:

1. Check the backend console output for the "DEV USER SEEDED" message
2. Verify the server is running in development mode
3. Restart the backend server - the user will be re-created automatically

### Database was reset/cleared

No problem! Just restart the server and the dev user will be automatically created again.

### Want to test a fresh database

Simply clear your database and restart the server. The dev user will be created immediately.

## Security Notes

üîí **Production Safety**:
- This seeding is **automatically disabled** in production environments
- The check is built into the seeding script itself
- Even if accidentally deployed, it will not run in production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Only**:
- These credentials are NOT suitable for production
- They are clearly marked as development-only
- They bypass certain security checks for development convenience

## Technical Details

### Implementation Files

- **Seeding Script**: `backend/prisma/dev-seed.ts`
- **Server Integration**: `backend/src/index.ts` (auto-imports and runs seed)
- **Runs**: BEFORE the server starts accepting HTTP requests
- **Method**: Database upsert (idempotent - safe to run multiple times)

### Environment Detection

The seeding only runs when:
```javascript
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
```

This ensures it never runs in production, staging, or testing environments.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about the dev login system, check:
