# Sprint 0: Infrastructure Setup - Overview
**Duration**: 1 Week
**Total Story Points**: 28
**Goal**: Complete development environment setup and project foundation

## Sprint Objectives
1. Initialize project structure with monorepo configuration
2. Set up Docker environment for all services
3. Configure Next.js frontend with required libraries
4. Configure Express backend with TypeScript
5. Implement database schema with Prisma
6. Set up development tooling and CI/CD pipeline

## Stories in This Sprint

| Story | Title | Points | Priority | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
| 001 | Project Initialization and Structure | 3 | CRITICAL | None |
| 002 | Docker Environment Setup | 5 | CRITICAL | 001 |
| 003 | Next.js Application Setup | 8 | CRITICAL | 001 |
| 004 | Express Backend Setup | 5 | CRITICAL | 001, 002 |
| 005 | Prisma Schema and Database | 5 | CRITICAL | 002, 004 |
| 006 | Development Tooling and CI/CD | 2 | HIGH | 001-005 |

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All code committed to Git repository
- [ ] All services running in Docker
- [ ] Frontend and backend servers start without errors
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team can pull and run the project locally

## Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Express 4.21.1, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Success Criteria
1. `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
2. Docker containers all healthy
3. Can create a test user in database
4. Frontend can make API call to backend
5. Prisma Studio opens and shows schema

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Version conflicts between dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Lock all versions in package.json
- **Risk**: Docker networking issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use single network for all services
- **Risk**: Database connection failures
  - **Mitigation**: Add retry logic and health checks

## Notes
- This sprint focuses entirely on infrastructure
- No business features will be implemented
- All team members should be able to run the project after completion
- Foundation for all future development

## Daily Standup Topics
- Day 1: Project setup, Git repository
- Day 2: Docker configuration
- Day 3: Frontend setup
- Day 4: Backend setup
- Day 5: Database and testing

## Sprint Retrospective Topics
- What worked well in setup?
- What took longer than expected?
- Any missing tools or configurations?
- Improvements for next sprint?
