## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Role-Based Access Control System
```typescript
// Permission categories implemented
const PERMISSION_CATEGORIES = {
  CONTENT: ['create', 'edit', 'publish', 'delete', 'manage_media'],
  ANALYTICS: ['view_reports', 'export_data', 'manage_competitors'],
  TEAM: ['view_members', 'invite_users', 'edit_roles', 'remove_users'],
  SETTINGS: ['manage_accounts', 'integrations', 'organization'],
  BILLING: ['access_billing', 'manage_subscriptions']
};

// Role definitions with specific permissions
const ROLES = {
  ADMINISTRATOR: ALL_PERMISSIONS,
  EDITOR: CONTENT_PERMISSIONS + VIEW_ANALYTICS + VIEW_TEAM,
  VIEWER: READ_ONLY_PERMISSIONS
};
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Development Process
- **Agent Specialization**: Dedicated agents for frontend, backend, testing, and documentation
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent development streams with proper synchronization
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and code review by specialized QA agents
