## 🚨 Known Issues to Address Next Session

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (20 remaining)
1. **analytics.routes.test.ts** - 10 errors
   - Unused parameters in mock implementations
   - Type mismatches in mock return values
   - Missing properties on mock objects

2. **Other test files** - ~10 errors
   - Similar mock type issues
   - Need systematic fix approach

### Test Failures (20 tests failing)
- Most are assertion mismatches, not infrastructure issues
- Need to review expected vs actual values
- Some mock setup may need adjustment

## 📋 Next Session Priority Tasks

### IMMEDIATE (Start Here) - P0
```bash
# 1. First, check current test status
cd /c/Users/drmwe/claude-workspace/social\ Media\ App/allin-platform/backend
bun jest --listTests | grep -E "\.test\.(ts|js)$" | wc -l  # Count total tests
bun jest --coverage --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Suites:|Tests:"  # Current metrics

# 2. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
# Focus on analytics.routes.test.ts first
# Apply the same mock casting pattern used for draft.service.test.ts

# 3. Implement critical route tests (0% coverage)
# Start with auth.routes.ts - most critical
# Then social.routes.ts and ai.routes.ts
```

### HIGH PRIORITY - P1
```bash
# 4. Run mutation testing
cd /c/Users/drmwe/claude-workspace/social\ Media\ App/allin-platform
npm run test:mutation  # or bun stryker run

# 5. Analyze coverage gaps
bun jest --coverage
# Open: coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# 6. Fix failing test assertions
# Focus on the 20 failing tests
# Most are assertion issues, not infrastructure
```

### STANDARD - P2
```bash
# 7. Implement E2E tests with Playwright
cd /c/Users/drmwe/claude-workspace/social\ Media\ App/allin-platform
bun playwright test

# 8. Set up CI/CD pipeline
# Use the working test commands
# Implement coverage gates (minimum 80%)
```

## 🛠️ Working Commands Reference

### Test Execution
```bash
# Backend tests
cd allin-platform/backend
bun jest --coverage              # Full coverage report
bun jest --passWithNoTests       # Run all tests
bun jest auth.service.test.ts    # Specific file
bun jest --watch                 # Watch mode

# Get test statistics
bun jest --listTests | wc -l     # Count test files
bun jest --coverage 2>&1 | grep "All files"  # Coverage summary
```

### Debugging Tests
```bash
# Run specific test suite with details
bun jest auth.service.test.ts --verbose

# Debug specific test
bun jest -t "should register a new user successfully" --detectOpenHandles

# Check for memory leaks
bun jest --logHeapUsage
```

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
bun jest --coverage

# Open HTML report (Windows)
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Check specific file coverage
bun jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="src/services/auth.service.ts"
```

## 📊 Target Metrics for Next Session

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Test Pass Rate | 80.4% | 95% | +14.6% |
| Overall Coverage | ~40% | 80% | +40% |
| Route Coverage | <10% | 60% | +50% |
| TypeScript Errors | 20 | 0 | -20 |
| Mutation Score | Unknown | ≥90% | Measure first |

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Next Session

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] Test pass rate ≥95%
- [ ] Route coverage ≥60%
- [ ] Overall coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Mutation testing executed and analyzed
- [ ] At least 3 route test files implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured

## 💡 Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with TypeScript fixes** - Can't test if it doesn't compile
2. **Use the mock casting pattern** - `(mock as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue()`
3. **Copy test structure** from auth.service.test.ts for new route tests
4. **Run tests frequently** - Every change should be validated
5. **Check background processes** - Dev server might interfere with tests

## 📝 Session Notes

### What Worked Well
- Bun package manager for test execution
- Mock casting pattern for Prisma
- Comprehensive auth service tests
- Type fixes in ai.service.ts

### What Needs Improvement
- Route test coverage (highest priority)
- TypeScript error resolution process
- Test assertion accuracy
- Mutation testing integration

### Blockers Resolved
- ✅ npm path issues → using bun
- ✅ Database connection → PostgreSQL configured
- ✅ Mock type issues → casting pattern
- ✅ Jest setup → comprehensive mocks

---

**Ready for Next Session**: The test infrastructure is stable and operational. Focus should be on expanding coverage, especially for routes, and achieving the quality metrics targets.

**Recommended First Action**: Run `bun jest --coverage` to see current state, then tackle auth.routes.ts test implementation.
