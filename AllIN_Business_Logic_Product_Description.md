## Troubleshooting Guide

### üîß Common Issues & Solutions

#### Account Connection Problems

**Issue: Instagram Account Won't Connect**

**Symptoms**:
- OAuth flow completes but account doesn't appear in dashboard
- "Connection failed" error message
- Account shows as "disconnected" shortly after connecting

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Account Type**: Ensure you're connecting a Business or Creator account, not a personal account
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear cookies and cache, then try connecting again
3. **Disable Browser Extensions**: Ad blockers can interfere with OAuth flow
4. **Check Instagram Settings**: Verify your account has API access enabled
5. **Try Different Browser**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility

**Advanced Troubleshooting**:
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
console.log('OAuth error details:', error);

// Verify redirect URI matches exactly
const redirectURI = 'https://app.allin-platform.com/auth/callback';
```

**Issue: Twitter/X Rate Limits**

**Symptoms**:
- Posts fail to publish with "rate limit" error
- Analytics data stops updating
- Account shows "limited" status

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Rate Limit Status**: Go to Settings > Connected Accounts
2. **Wait for Reset**: Rate limits reset every 15 minutes
3. **Reduce Posting Frequency**: Space out posts more evenly
4. **Upgrade Twitter Plan**: Consider Twitter API v2 with higher limits

#### Content Creation Issues

**Issue: AI Content Generation Fails**

**Symptoms**:
- "Generation failed" error message
- Blank content returned
- Very low-quality or irrelevant content

**Solutions**:
1. **Check API Credits**: Verify you have sufficient AI credits remaining
2. **Improve Prompts**: Be more specific and detailed in your content requests
3. **Check Content Guidelines**: Ensure request doesn't violate platform policies
4. **Try Different Parameters**: Adjust tone, length, or style settings

**Example of Good vs. Bad Prompts**:
```
‚ùå Bad: "Create a post"
‚úÖ Good: "Create an engaging Instagram post about our new eco-friendly product launch, targeting environmentally conscious millennials, with an upbeat and informative tone"
```

**Issue: Image Generation Problems**

**Symptoms**:
- Images don't match description
- Generation takes too long or fails
- Images are low quality or incorrect size

**Solutions**:
1. **Be Descriptive**: Use detailed, specific descriptions
2. **Specify Style**: Indicate photography, illustration, or graphic design

4. **Check Dimensions**: Verify correct sizing for target platform

#### Scheduling & Publishing Issues

**Issue: Posts Not Publishing at Scheduled Time**

**Symptoms**:

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Account Connections**: Verify all target accounts are properly connected
2. **Review Content Guidelines**: Ensure content meets platform requirements
3. **Check Character Limits**: Verify content doesn't exceed platform limits
4. **Verify Media Files**: Ensure images/videos are accessible and properly formatted

**Issue: Bulk Upload Failures**

**Symptoms**:
- CSV import fails or imports partial data
- Error messages during bulk operation
- Posts created but not scheduled properly

**Solutions**:
1. **Check CSV Format**: Use provided template exactly

#### Analytics & Reporting Problems

**Issue: Missing Analytics Data**

**Symptoms**:
- Charts show no data or partial data
- Analytics updates slowly or not at all
- Discrepancies between platforms

**Solutions**:

2. **Wait for Processing**: Analytics can take 24-48 hours to fully populate
3. **Check Date Ranges**: Ensure selected dates have published content
4. **Refresh Connections**: Disconnect and reconnect accounts if data is stale

**Issue: Export Functions Not Working**

**Symptoms**:
- PDF/Excel downloads fail
- Empty reports generated
- Export takes too long or times out

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce Date Range**: Try shorter time periods for large reports
2. **Check Browser Settings**: Ensure downloads are enabled
3. **Try Different Format**: If PDF fails, try Excel or CSV

### üîß Integration Implementation

#### Common Integration Scenarios

**CRM Integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)**:
```javascript
// Example: Sync social leads to CRM
const leadData = {
  email: socialLead.email,
  source: 'AllIN Platform',
  platform: socialLead.platform,
  engagement_score: socialLead.interactions,
  first_contact: socialLead.timestamp
};

// Send to CRM via webhook
await fetch(CRM_WEBHOOK_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
});
```

**E-commerce Integration (Shopify)**:
```javascript
// Sync product updates to social posts
const productUpdate = {
  product_id: product.id,
  action: 'new_product',
  content_template: 'new_arrival',
  platforms: ['instagram', 'facebook'],
  schedule: 'immediate'
};

await allinAPI.createPost(productUpdate);
```

**Analytics Integration (Google Analytics)**:
```javascript
// Track social media conversions
gtag('event', 'social_conversion', {
  event_category: 'Social Media',
  event_label: 'AllIN Platform',
  value: conversionValue,
  custom_parameters: {
    platform: sourcePlatform,
    campaign: campaignName
  }
});
```

#### Custom Development Guidelines

**API Best Practices**:
1. **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 for user-facing apps, API keys for server-to-server
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling
3. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and retry logic
4. **Data Validation**: Validate all inputs before sending to API
5. **Security**: Never expose API credentials in client-side code

**Webhook Implementation**:
```javascript
// Example webhook handler
app.post('/webhook/allin', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-allin-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);

  // Verify webhook signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  // Process webhook event
  handleWebhookEvent(req.body);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
